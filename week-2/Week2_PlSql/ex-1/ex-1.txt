Scenario-1:
--Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.
DECLARE
  CURSOR customer_cursor IS
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM Customers
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM SYSDATE) - EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DOB) > 60;
BEGIN
  FOR customer IN customer_cursor LOOP
    UPDATE Loans
    SET InterestRate = InterestRate * 0.99
    WHERE CustomerID = customer.CustomerID;
  END LOOP;

Scenario-2:
--Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a balance over $10,000.
BEGIN
  FOR customer IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers WHERE Balance > 10000) LOOP
    UPDATE Customers
    SET IsVIP = TRUE
    WHERE CustomerID = customer.CustomerID;
  END LOOP;

Scenario-3:
--Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each customer.
BEGIN
  FOR loan IN (SELECT LoanID, CustomerID FROM Loans WHERE EndDate <= SYSDATE + 30) LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: Loan ID ' || loan.LoanID || ' is due within 30 days for customer ' || loan.CustomerID);
